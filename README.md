# organicEcommerceStore
Organic is a multi-page e-commerce site with a fully functional shopping cart connected to a real-time database, advanced product search and filter, scroll effects using Intersection Observation API, image carousel gallery and is fully responsive down to 320px.<br />

I learned a lot during this project in terms of problem-solving and programming. A few key lessons were:<br />
Basics of Modular Javascript<br />
Integration of Firebase for persistent data flow <br />
Exploring some more awesome JS array methods <br />
Using a preprocessor like SCSS/SASS <br />
